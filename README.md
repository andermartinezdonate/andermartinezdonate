## Hi, I'm Ander 👋

**From Geophysicist to Data Engineer | Data • ML • Cloud Computing**

I hold a PhD in Geophysics from the University of Manchester (UK) and previously worked
in academia on energy systems characterization at The University of Texas at Austin (USA).

My growing interest in data and extracting insights from complex systems led me to
deepen my technical skills with two master’s degrees — one in Machine Learning and
another in Cloud Computing. That experience became a turning point, and I decided
to fully transition into the world of data.

I now work as a Data Engineer at **T-Systems (Deutsche Telekom)**, building modern,
scalable, production-ready data platforms using cloud and analytics engineering best practices.
