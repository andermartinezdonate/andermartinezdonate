## Hi, I'm Ander 👋

From Geophysicist to Data Engineer | Data • ML • Cloud Computing

I hold a PhD in Geophysics from the University of Manchester (UK) and previously worked
in academia on energy systems characterization at The University of Texas at Austin (USA).

My growing interest in data and extracting insights from complex systems led me to
deepen my technical skills through two master’s degrees: one in Machine Learning
and another in Cloud Computing.

That experience marked a turning point, pushing me to fully transition into the
world of data. I now work as a Data Engineer at T-Systems (Deutsche Telekom), focused on
building modern, scalable, production-ready data platforms using cloud and analytics
engineering best practices.

### What I work with
- Cloud & Data: GCP, BigQuery, dbt, Apache Iceberg  
- Programming: Python, SQL  
- Data Engineering: analytics engineering, data modeling, data pipelines  
- ML: applied machine learning for real-world data problems  

### Personal projects
This GitHub profile contains my personal projects in data engineering, cloud computing,
and applied machine learning, with a focus on modern data platforms and analytics workflows.
